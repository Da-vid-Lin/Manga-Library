    "synopsis": "Kenzou Tenma, a renowned Japanese neurosurgeon working in post-war Germany, faces a difficult choice: to operate on Johan Liebert, an orphan boy on the verge of death, or on the mayor of Düsseldorf. In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.\n\nAs a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The impact melted the continental ice mass and drastically raised sea levels, damaging the world's climate and causing the deaths of over half its population. Now in 2015, devastating creatures of unknown origin—referred to as Angels—ravage what remains of the planet.\n\nIn the heavily fortified city of Tokyo-3, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari is destined to halt the Angels' onslaught. Recruited by his father's secret organization, NERV, Shinji is enlisted as a pilot of an Evangelion, a massive bioorganic android created solely to defeat the Angels.\n\nSuddenly with the weight of the world upon his shoulders, Shinji must find the courage and drive to stand up for the future—and himself. But as skirmishes between the Evangelions and Angels become recurrent, the horrifying truth of the world is slowly revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Strange creatures known as \"Mimics\" have invaded Earth, sparking a global war that has humanity fighting for survival. In response, mankind forms the United Defense Force, a joint organization whose purpose is to overcome this new threat. Dedicated to the extermination of the growing Mimic menace, soldiers are plunged into battle, wearing special exoskeleton combat suits in an attempt to gain the upper hand against their foes.\n\nNew recruit Keiji Kiriya is immediately killed after his very first deployment, but to his shock, he wakes up exactly one day before his unit was dropped into a Mimic invasion. After experiencing the same event yet again, he realizes that he is stuck in a time loop triggered by his death. As he relives the day of the battle hundreds of times, Keiji begins to make use of what he has learned about the phenomenon, gradually building up his strength and improving his skills so that eventually, when he comes face-to-face with death once more, he will be ready to change his fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, they find themselves receiving a seemingly regular job from the police: kill a rival pimp and his prostitute. However, this job is not all that it seems, as it takes the pair down a dangerous path and triggers events that could change the very framework of Ergastulum forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "America, 1938. Robert E. O. Speedwagon, his foundation, and Straits venture to Mexico to gather more information about the enigmatic Stone Masks. While excavating the ruins, Speedwagon's men are slaughtered by Strait's sudden betrayal and his lust for power, putting Speedwagon in grave danger.\n\nMeanwhile, at the behest of their ally Speedwagon, Joseph Joestar and his grandmother Erina Pendleton have moved to New York City from London. In this new environment, trouble is always around the corner for the hotheaded man, as cultural differences and stubborn citizens spark frequent fights. However, through the power of his \"Ripple\"—an ability said to be inherited from his grandfather Jonathan Joestar—he defeats foes effortlessly.\n\nOne night at a downtown Italian restaurant, Joseph and Erina are provoked when an enormous man across their table taunts them. A proper gentleman from the same table apologizes and informs the two of a disturbing rumor: Speedwagon has been murdered. With an uncertain future, Joseph's bizarre adventure begins, meeting like-minded yet brawny individuals and unearthing remote mysteries along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Punpun Onodera is a normal 11-year-old boy living in Japan. Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naive boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\n\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Neo-Tokyo, hastily built on the ruins of old Tokyo, is a sprawling cityscape of neon extravaganza. It is a fusion of towering skyscrapers and cutting-edge technology that is permeated through and through with an explosive, hyper-violent cocktail of biker gangs, poverty, and revolutionaries. In this derelict metropolis live Tetsuo Shima and Shoutarou Kaneda, two bikers who are the best of friends and the fiercest of rivals, despite being affiliated with the same gang. Desperate to prove himself as Kaneda's equal, Tetsuo unwittingly pulls a stunt that culminates in the awakening of a cryptic existence that threatens to change both the face of Neo-Tokyo and the lives of those who call the city their home—the awakening of a government secret simply known as Akira. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In a high school classroom, students mourn the loss of one of their own: Tomie Kawakami, who has been murdered and dismembered. Shocked by the announcement of her death, the class is puzzled by the cruel fate that has befallen someone so dear to them; such a radiant and beautiful girl did not deserve such a hideous demise. However, a strikingly familiar student suddenly appears at the classroom's entrance. Gorgeous, slender, and with a beauty mark under her left eye, Tomie smiles and apologizes for being late.\n \nBut this is just the beginning of the mysteries surrounding this seemingly inhuman woman. The men unlucky enough to catch her eye become smitten with her instantly, but also become driven by a dark impulse to dismember her, one they often succumb to. And each time, Tomie returns from the dead to continue her favorite pastime: toying with men.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Hunted almost to extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called \"Titans,\" humanity found refuge by hiding within walled cities. However, with the passing centuries, ignorance fell upon the masses who forgot the Titan menace and have grown perfectly content to live within their fortresses. Angel Aaltonen is no different until, after witnessing the Titan's devastation firsthand, he starts to realize how fragile mankind's safe haven is. Resolved to protect his friends from the threat, the craftsman sets out to create a device powerful enough to fight the Titans.\n\nOver a decade later, Kuklo—who was discovered in Titan vomit as a baby and henceforth dubbed the \"Titan's son\"—finds himself freed from the cage that has held him since infancy. Aware that his life is now in his own hands, the boy soon finds a cause to live for: to meet a Titan face to face and understand why humans have only ever seen him as an object of fear. Thus Kuklo decides to join the Survey Corps, unaware that he may be the person the stagnant military unit has been looking for.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin: Before the Fall tells two separate yet connected tales which detail humanity's struggle, loss, and determination to transcend the role of helpless prey and strike back against the Titans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Hundreds of years ago, horrifying creatures which resembled humans appeared. These mindless, towering giants, called Titans, proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the Titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world.\n\nIn the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with Titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter Titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single Titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the blink of an eye, the night sky is forever changed when, with a great explosion, the moon is blasted into a permanent crescent. Confronting the governments of the world, a yellow tentacled monster boasts that it was the one responsible for the catastrophe, and in a year's time, it will do the same to Earth. Zooming around at Mach 20, the creature makes a peculiar demand: a teaching position at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task—assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\n\nAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with. Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 21: Tokyo Department Sensou Taikenki (Tokyo Department Store War Chronicles)",

    "synopsis": "As a relatively unknown minor deity without any worshippers, Delivery God Yato takes on odd jobs for only five yen, with the goal of amassing a fortune large enough to buy himself a shrine. But in addition to obscurity, he has another problem: his Shinki, or weapon partner, has decided to resign, tired of being with a homeless god. Left with no weapon, Yato takes on more jobs, hoping to find a new partner soon.\n\nWhile out putting up fliers for a missing cat, Yato sees said cat and chases after him, right into the path of an oncoming vehicle. Hiyori Iki, a nearby girl, rushes to push Yato out of the way and ends up hurting herself. After waking up in the hospital, she discovers the incident has knocked her soul loose from her body. Realizing his actions caused this, Yato promises to help return Hiyori to normal—for five yen of course. But in order to return her to normal, he requires a new Shinki, which he finds in the rebellious spirit Yukine.\n\nNoragami tells the story of a girl walking the line between two worlds and a stray deity's quest for a place to call his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soon after, his foster father becomes possessed and dies at the hands of Satan, leaving Rin and his twin brother Yukio alone in the world. Seeking revenge for Fujimoto's death, Rin attends True Cross Academy with Yukio in order to become an exorcist and join the Knights of the True Cross.\n\nRin's new path, however, is filled with many difficulties. While new classes and dealing with his peers are already troublesome enough, he is also forced to conceal his newfound demonic powers and parentage. In addition, plenty of evildoers want to use him for their own ends.

    "synopsis": "One day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is not fair. Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as \"quirks,\" which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High.\n\nHowever, everything changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The further away one is from the capital, the darker and more dangerous it is. In the surrounding areas of Yuusari and Yodaka exist enormous armored bug creatures called Gaichuu that prey on people's hearts. Despite this, it is the duty of Letter Bees, a special group of mail carriers, to deliver letters throughout Amberground while risking their lives battling the Gaichuu.\n\nTwelve-year-old Lag Seeing aspires to become a Letter Bee like Gauche Suede after their fateful meeting five years ago, where Gauche \"delivered\" Lag himself as a letter sent by his missing mother. Determined to see Gauche again and uncover the truth behind his mother's disappearance, Lag begins his journey to become a Letter Bee.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Thousands of years ago, there existed those gifted with the power of God. Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. \n\nTo prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.\n\nUpon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Sixth grader Shou Takamatsu is a troublemaker who refuses to grow up. However, one fateful day, his world is turned upside down, forcing him to quickly mature—or die. When Shou arrives at school that morning, an earthquake of mysterious origin strikes, and the campus is teleported to an empty wasteland, far removed from society. Not only do Shou and his peers face an immediate crisis of food shortage, they must also contend with other problems, including new and dangerous external threats, and rising conflict among the student body. With the adults having a hard time adjusting, Shou finds the immense responsibility to quickly adapt to his new dystopian reality a heavy burden on his small shoulders.\n\nWritten by the horror specialist Kazuo Umezu, Hyouryuu Kyoushitsu is regarded as a classic in its genre—a unique blend of the riveting mystery behind the entrapment of Shou and his classmates on the barren, hostile world, and their struggle for survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The Shaman Fight—a prestigious tournament pitting shamans from all over the world against each other—is held every five hundred years, where the winner is crowned Shaman King. This title allows the current incumbent to call upon the Great Spirit and shape the world as they see fit.\n \nFinding himself late for class one night, Manta Oyamada, an ordinary middle school student, decides to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Noticing him, a lone boy sitting on a gravestone invites Manta to stargaze with \"them.\" Realizing that \"them\" refers to the boy and his ghostly friends, Manta flees in terror. Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This entry is for the original printing of Shaman King.

One day, a girl with a scar on her forehead named Kouko Ishigami, accompanied by a ghost of a tall and friendly man, transfers into his class.\n\nFuuta quickly takes a liking to Kouko, wondering if it might be love at first sight. After waking up crying from a strange dream involving her, he feels a nostalgic connection to Kouko and becomes determined to befriend her. However, a chain of events forces Fuuta to reveal his birthmark to Kouko, to which she declares him to be the enemy of her life. A furious Kouko explains that the two are bound by reincarnation, and that Fuuta's birthmark is a curse she engraved on him in one of their past lives to recognize and eventually defeat him.\n \nKouko brings out a circular object made of flames known as the \"spirit circle\" and attacks Fuuta, pushing him off a flight of stairs. As he falls, Fuuta is thrown back into the insight of one of his previous lives. Spirit Circle chronicles Fuuta's journey back and forth his several past lives as he gradually unravels the mysteries behind his apparent bad blood with Kouko.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma.\n\nRanma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Shouya Ishida, a mischievous elementary school student, finds himself troubled by deaf transfer student Shouko Nishimiya. Despite her genuine attempts to befriend her new classmates, Shouko only proves herself to be an annoyance for Shouya and his friends, provoking them to ridicule her at any possible chance. Soon enough, their taunts turn into constant assault—yet the teachers heartlessly remain apathetic to the situation.\n\nShouya's misdeeds are finally stopped when Shouko transfers to another school. Denying their involvement, the entire class puts the blame on Shouya. As the new victim of bullying, Shouya gradually becomes meek and reclusive, being treated with contempt and disregard for years to come.\n\nNow a high school student, Shouya meets Shouko again for the first time in five years. Still tormented by his past actions, Shouya is determined to make amends for his mistakes and confront his trauma—even if he must face arduous obstacles along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

And probably not for the better.\n\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\n\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.\n\nSetting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

As she walks to the train station one day to meet her boyfriend, Shuuichi Saito, she sees his father staring at a snail shell in an alley. Thinking nothing of it, she mentions the incident to Shuuichi, who says that his father has been acting weird lately. Shuuichi reveals his rising desire to leave the town with Kirie, saying that the town is infected with spirals.\n\nBut his father's obsession with the shape soon proves deadly, beginning a chain of horrific and unexplainable events that causes the residents of Kurouzu-cho to spiral into madness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside the notebook, he finds a chilling message: those whose names are written in it shall die. Its nonsensical nature amuses Light; but when he tests its power by writing the name of a criminal in it, they suddenly meet their demise.\n\nRealizing the Death Note's vast potential, Light commences a series of nefarious murders under the pseudonym \"Kira,\" vowing to cleanse the world of corrupt individuals and create a perfect society where crime ceases to exist. However, the police quickly catch on, and they enlist the help of L—a mastermind detective—to uncover the culprit.\n\nDeath Note tells the thrilling tale of Light and L as they clash in a great battle-of-minds, one that will determine the future of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\n\nYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Attacked by a strange, four-legged fish in their cabin, they manage to kill it, but are left unsettled by the putrid stench it carried—the haunting smell of death.\n\nThis lone assault is only the herald of what's to come, as soon, many more such creatures emerge from the sea, attacking anything in their path. Though Tadashi and Kaori quickly return to Tokyo, they find there is no longer any safe haven; no matter where they run, the death stench creeps...\n\nAmigara Dansou no Kai (The Enigma of Amigara Fault)\nAfter a devastating earthquake near Amigara mountain, a several-kilometer-long fault emerged. But this discovery was made more eerie by the thousands of human-shaped holes scattered among the rock face, each of which seemingly continues for miles within the mountain. Oowaki, one of the many spectators attracted to the sight, witnesses in horror as onlookers start to experience a personal, visceral calling to enter these holes—formed as if to fit only them.\n\nDaikokubashira Hiwa (The Sad Tale of the Principal Post)\nCelebrating their recent move into their new house, a family's festivities are cut short upon hearing the cries of their father. Finding him in the crawl space below, they bear witness to the bizarre and unexplainable tragedy that has befallen him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Hachimitsu Private Academy, an elite all-girls high school, opens its grandiose doors to male students for the first time in its history. The five males who enroll, however, are a merry band of perverts who are unable to communicate with girls! This cluster of misfits is composed of the foreign delinquent Shingo, the strange and sickly \"Jo,\" the overweight \"Andrei,\" the intelligent \"Gakuto,\" and Kiyoshi, the most normal person of the bunch. \n\nFeeling troubled due to their lack of female interaction, the five boys embark on a dangerous mission to peek on several girls while they are bathing. However, owing to a series of mishaps, their operation ultimately fails, resulting in the boys' actions being exposed to the entire school.\n\nFor their crimes, the boys are sentenced to one month of imprisonment by the menacing Underground Student Council. Little do the unforgiving beauties of the council know, the boys' perverted and unusual antics are just going to worsen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On his way back from a job, he finds a strange calling card with the word \"Psyren\" imprinted left behind in a phone booth and decides to keep it, unaware of its purpose. The very next day, Ageha discovers that his classmate Sakurako Amamiya has the exact same calling card in her possession. When he questions her, Sakurako asks him to save her, signaling the day his troubles begin.\n\nConfused by the circumstances of this encounter, Ageha realizes something is wrong when Sakurako goes missing. In an attempt to figure out what is happening, he decides to call the number provided on the calling card and is asked a series of questions by a mysterious voice, ending with a final, cryptic question: \"Would you like to go to Psyren?\" Thus begins two teenagers' participation in a game of life or death within a strange world inhabited by monsters called Taboo. Granted the ability to use psychic powers known as PSI, the duo fight to return to the place they call home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Tadaomi Shirotani is the secretary to the company president of Tosawa Corporation—and is a severe mysophobe. His obsessive-compulsive disorder has limited him in every aspect, from being unable to leave the house without a pair of gloves on, to cleaning his hands vigorously enough to make them bleed.\n\nWhen the president gets into an accident, he is saved by a mysterious young man who departs as quickly as he appears. Ordered to go after him, Shirotani meets Riku Kurose, a man who is able to quickly identify his mysophobia. Begrudgingly taking his advice to seek help from a professional, Shirotani visits Shimada Psychosomatics with the hope of seeing a psychiatrist. When he once again runs into Kurose there, the man reveals that he himself is a counselor at the clinic, and offers to treat Shirotani's condition.\n\nKurose asks him to write a list of 10 things he is reluctant to do—thus beginning his course of exposure therapy. Yet, Shirotani wonders why Kurose would show such kindness to a stranger. After all, the two have barely met, and Kurose does not deny the accusations of an ulterior motive. With number 10 on the list left blank by an undecided Shirotani, Kurose issues a challenge. Once Shirotani figures out the last item, the thing he would hate to do the most, only then will his newfound counselor finally tell him the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The protagonist of this story, Aichi Sendou, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going—the \"Blaster Blade,\" a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Card Fights, something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is \"Vanguard.\" The game takes place at a different planet called \"Cray,\" and due to a never-before-seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
